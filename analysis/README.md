## Smart City (Smart Street Light Pole) Simulation

Discrete-event based simulation would be used to solve this problem based on the various inputs and outputs that would need to be assessed.

I chose this simulation type to be used in the simulation of the smart street pole light based on the behaviors over time creating the need for various response types.

The simulation would be conducted with individuals utilizing the emergency call system, responding to the concealed placement speaker system, measure the response of the light pole based on the perception forecasts, and enhance the environmental sensors to ensure the responses are effective.
