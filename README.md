## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

It is extremely critical to design and implement such a smart street light post that includes Concealed Placement Speakers (CPS) for the purpose of playing music through the streets, announcing important events, and sounding alarms.   It is important because of the ability to utilize the digital street sign to display such things as the street name, event, parking direction, and evacuation directions.  The most import aspect of the smart street light pole is the concealed image sensor providing security monitoring, pedestrian awareness, as well as the aspect of homeland security.  Solving and implementing this problem/solution is based on the funds for production of such a enhanced street light pole, determining the space between poles on each street, network capability to manage the possible thousands of street light poles.

> 1. Provides real time broadcast and alert notification system

> 2. Provides real time emergency response call system

> 3. Enhances the street sign capabilities with the digital capabilities

> 4. Smart LED lights adapt to the sun light exposure maximizing energy use



From the research conducted I have not detected any real-world implementations only with the aspect of speaking crossing walk poles.  I believe the identification of a city that would be the test subject for the smart street lights needs to be identified.



The history of the smart street light pole could potentially originates form several aspects such as warning systems, road signs identifying parking and evacuation routes, homeland security monitoring systems enhancing the security of the city, and the push to talk emergency system.  There is a proposed solution that I have found from the city of San Francisco at http://www.citymart.com/previous-challenges-content/2014/8/6/san-francisco-vision-zero-for-traffic-safety.  San Francisco has identified the need for these smart street light poles however the funding and implementation has to be outlined.



## Requirements (Experimental Design)



A smart street light pole will increase civilian awareness in a given area, control possible traffic choke points within a given area, increase emergency response times by implementing more alarm locations, and increase the homeland security monitoring capabilities with thousands of enhanced camera systems.  This form of hypothesis helps us to identify the required inputs, outputs and functions of the street light poles.  The inputs are the needs of the civilians with a given area, traffic patterns, heavy traffic times, types of criminal activity, times of crime, and the types of music to sooth the area reducing the levels of stress. The outputs are very simple based on the abilities of the street light pole such as emergency touch response, concealed speakers, digital street signs with the ability to change adapting to the situation.  The functions of the street light pole are to enhance the monitoring of the given area.

## Smart City (Smart Street Light Poles) Simulation



The simulation aspect of the design is critical to test the actual products within the pole.  The water detection, environmental sensors, and the concealed placement speaker system are essential.  The smart street light pole will enhance the city environment by providing essential resources at the fingertips of the end users.
